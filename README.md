### Note

I am mainly a React developer as this is what my job wants me to be, but during this short period that I have learned and used Svelte was something amazing. My understanding of javascript and other UI libraries and frameworks helped me grasp the basics and core functionalities of Svelte in such a short time so this may not be the best Svelte code out there but it was an amazing learning journey to complete the assignment. I'll be learning more about what Svelte has to offer.






# create-svelte

Everything you need to build a Svelte project, powered by [`create-svelte`](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/tree/main/packages/create-svelte).

## Creating a project

If you're seeing this, you've probably already done this step. Congrats!

```bash
# create a new project in the current directory
npm create svelte@latest

# create a new project in my-app
npm create svelte@latest my-app
```

## Developing

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.

> To deploy your app, you may need to install an [adapter](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/adapters) for your target environment.
